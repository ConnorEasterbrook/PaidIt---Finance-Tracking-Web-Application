    Create and display savings goals, and allowing for users to set a deadline for their goal. Then display information for how much per week and month would need to be deposited to achieve this goal.

    Paid versions of the app can let users automatically assign a percentage of their savings to the goal upon data input. 
    - This would require changing how data input works. Implementing a button that allows you to enter amount changes rather than total should be fine.
    - - In doing this, it is vital to have a menu where the user can select the savings & goals that will have their calue changed. 
    - - - In this window you can change the amount you wish to put towards the savings goals.

    This would need to be saved in the userdata.JSON file as that is the storage method of choice for this application
